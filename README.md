#More than an simple android app

##This application was designed to be an education tool and be used inside classes, helping professors simulate commodities' market without exposing the students to any risk.
After creating an account as professor you're able to create infinite classes and decide agricultural commodities to trade. if the pricess go up, you're richer, otherwise...
There's no limit of participants and the professor can register a monitor key. This kind of user have the same privilegies that the professor.
Users can't exclude classes created by others but they can exit.
All movimentation (buy or sell) are registered but the user can only see his and professor's movimentation.
This is very importante because you can explain why are you doing that, so professors can teach using this feature.
It has some charts too. You can choose what you want to visualize, wealth or variation. The chart will show you the professor follow by the first five positions.
The last bar is always you.
